This document integrates every concept we've discussed: the universal audience, the advanced AI multi-bot architecture, the platform economy, global localization, and now, a hybrid database architecture using both PostgreSQL and a Graph Database (like Neo4j) for unparalleled relationship-based matching.
It is structured to be the single source of truth for "vibe coding"—providing not just the "what" but the "how" and "why," including conceptual CLI commands to represent the development actions.

GRANADA: The Master Blueprint for the Universal AI-Native OS
________________________________________
Part 1: Foundational Architecture & Core Logic
1.1. Core Technology Stack
•	Primary Backend Language: Python (3.11+)
•	Backend Framework: FastAPI
•	Frontend Language: TypeScript
•	Frontend Framework: React (with Next.js)
•	Primary Database (Transactional & Vector): PostgreSQL (with PgVector & PostGIS extensions)
o	Logic: Handles all structured data (users, organizations, projects, financials, documents) and performs high-speed semantic vector searches.
•	Secondary Database (Relational & Graph): Neo4j (or similar Graph DB)
o	Logic: Models complex, many-to-many relationships. Essential for advanced matching where the path between entities matters (e.g., "Find investors who funded companies founded by people from my university").
•	In-Memory Store: Redis (for caching, real-time messaging, and task queuing).
•	Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose.
1.2. The "Vibe Coding" Command Philosophy
To make this blueprint actionable, we'll use a conceptual command-line interface (CLI) syntax. These commands represent the "vibe" or intent of a development sprint or task.
•	granada generate:module [module_name] - Creates the full directory structure for a new module.
•	granada generate:page [module_name]/[page_name] - Creates the frontend component files for a new page.
•	granada generate:bot [bot_name] --language=python - Scaffolds the files for a new AI bot.
•	granada db:migrate "[migration_description]" - Generates and applies a database schema change.
•	granada deploy:service [service_name] - Deploys a specific microservice.

Section 4.0: Core Functional Modules
This encompasses all the specialized suites.
•	Pages (65+): Covering Strategic Planning, Funding, Project Execution, M&E, Academic, Business, Career, Creative, Governance, and Office Editors.
•	Flows (~60+): From "Write a Grant" to "Simulate an Interview" and "Analyze a Contract."
•	AI Bots (~60+): Including AI Proposal Bot, AI Logistics Bot, AI Literature Review Bot, AI CV Bot, AI Video Bot, AI Contract Analysis Bot, etc.
•	Key Bot Architecture: Hybrid Database Matching
o	Bot: Advanced Investor Matching Bot
o	Languages: Python, Cypher (for Neo4j), SQL (for PostgreSQL).
o	Business Logic: Find an investor for a startup who not only invests in their sector but has a trusted connection to the founder.
o	Algorithm:
1.	User initiates a search for investors.
2.	PostgreSQL Query (Semantic Search): The backend first queries PostgreSQL to find investors whose investment thesis (text) is semantically similar to the startup's pitch deck summary (text). (SELECT investor_id FROM investors WHERE vector_similarity > 0.8) -> This provides a list of potentially good fits.
3.	Graph DB Query (Relational Search): The backend then takes this list of potential investors and queries the Neo4j graph database. Core Logic: The Cypher query looks for the shortest path between the (Founder) node and the (Investor) nodes from the previous step. MATCH p=shortestPath((f:Person {id: 'founder_id'})-[*..6]-(i:Investor)) WHERE i.id IN [potential_investor_ids] RETURN i, p
4.	The query might find a path like: (Founder) -> [ATTENDED] -> (University) <- [ATTENDED] <- (Person) -> [WORKED_AT] -> (Company) <- [FUNDED] <- (Investor).
5.	Synthesizer Bot: An AI bot analyzes these results and decides on the final ranking. It prioritizes investors who are both a good semantic fit AND have a close relational path to the founder.
o	Control Flow (ASCII) for Hybrid Search:
