For Granada, given your app has distinct user groups (NGOs, students, businesses, general users) and an academic-research publishing backbone (with journal ecosystems, user pipelines, and dashboards), an Admin Dashboard must be robust, secure, and insightful. It should allow full control over user activity, content management, system operations, and data analytics.

Below is a detailed breakdown of admin dashboard elements for Granada based on your current architecture:

    Model Version Tracking (which models are active)

    Feedback Loop Analysis (user thumbs up/down on AI answers)

    Prompt History & Token Usage Reports

    Fine-tuning Feedback Collection Interface

Final Notes

The Admin Dashboard should be built in modular cards or tabs, prioritizing responsive design (especially for tablet admin use), with user-level access restrictions (super admin vs. thematic editor vs. tech admin).

If you're using React for frontend, pairing it with Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, and Recharts for analytics would provide speed and visual elegance. For backend integration, FastAPI’s dependency injection system should help manage permissions cleanly.

If you'd like, I can generate a mock frontend layout or admin wireframe next.

Given the evolving scope of Granada, which already integrates academic publishing, NGO pipelines, research tooling, and diverse user roles (NGOs, students, businesses, general users), the Admin Dashboard must now be extended to incorporate three core domains: Human Resources (HR), Accounting & Finance, and User Submissions Tracking. Each of these domains needs a tailored suite of features, fully integrated within the main admin architecture to allow centralized oversight and traceable workflows.

Integration & Permissions

All these modules must be deeply integrated into a role-based access control (RBAC) system:

    HR Manager Role: restricted to staff records and HR tools

    Finance Officer Role: accounting dashboards, no access to user messages

    Editorial/Admin Reviewers: proposals and academic paper reviews only

    Regional Admins (optional): restricted view based on district/region

You may connect each module to FastAPI backend endpoints, and the frontend (React + Tailwind) should use dynamic tab interfaces or accordion-style nested panels for clarity. Use Framer Motion for transition animations to enhance UX.
